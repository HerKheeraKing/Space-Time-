# About the Space-Time Explorer:

  <p align="center"> This Unity-based space exploration game was built using Blender and Sketchfab assets to create an immersive environment for learning. Players roam freely through alien terrain, collecting stars while uncovering facts about astronomy along the way.
  </p>

<p align="center"> Designed with educational intent, the game supports both keyboard controls and Xbox controllers. It also links to my 6-DOF Stewart Platform, which syncs with the player's movement to simulate real-world motion in real time.<br>                                          <br> Tools: Unity, Blender, Sketch Fab, C++
